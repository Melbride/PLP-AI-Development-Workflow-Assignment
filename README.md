## Assignment Overview

This assignment demonstrates understanding of the AI Development Workflow through:

1. **Short Answer Questions (30 points)** - Covering problem definition, data preprocessing, model development, and deployment
2. **Case Study Application (40 points)** - Hospital patient readmission prediction system
3. **Critical Thinking (20 points)** - Ethics, bias, and trade-off analysis
4. **Reflection & Workflow Diagram (10 points)** - Process understanding and visualization

## Key Features

### Student Dropout Prediction (Part 1)
- Random Forest classifier for predicting student dropout risk
- Comprehensive preprocessing pipeline
- KPI: Precision at 80% recall threshold
- Feature importance analysis

### Patient Readmission Prediction (Case Study)
- XGBoost classifier for 30-day readmission risk
- HIPAA-compliant design considerations
- Bias analysis and fairness assessment
- Real-time prediction API design

### Bias Analysis Framework
- Demographic parity analysis
- Equalized odds assessment
- Comprehensive bias reporting
- Mitigation strategy recommendations

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd AI_Development_Workflow_Assignment
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the implementations:

python code/bias_analysis.py
```

## Key Technical Implementations

### Data Preprocessing
- Missing value imputation using median/mode
- Feature normalization with StandardScaler
- Categorical encoding with LabelEncoder
- Feature engineering for domain-specific insights

### Model Development
- Stratified train/validation/test splits
- Hyperparameter tuning considerations
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Feature importance analysis for interpretability

### Ethical Considerations
- Bias detection across demographic groups
- Fairness metrics implementation
- Privacy protection strategies
- Regulatory compliance (HIPAA) considerations

## Results and Insights

### Student Dropout Prediction
- Achieved target KPI of precision at 80% recall
- Key predictors: First semester GPA, attendance rate, assignment submission rate
- Identified socioeconomic bias in LMS engagement data

### Patient Readmission Prediction
- 80% recall with 61.5% precision on synthetic data
- Most important features: Length of stay, number of diagnoses, comorbidities
- Demonstrated bias mitigation strategies for healthcare equity

## Ethical Framework

The implementation includes comprehensive bias analysis addressing:
- **Demographic Parity**: Equal positive prediction rates across groups
- **Equalized Odds**: Equal TPR and FPR across protected groups
- **Individual Fairness**: Similar individuals receive similar predictions
- **Counterfactual Fairness**: Decisions unaffected by sensitive attributes

## Future Improvements

1. **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Incorporate temporal patterns and interaction effects
2. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for improved robustness
3. **Federated Learning**: Enable privacy-preserving collaborative training
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement drift detection and automated retraining
5. **Explainable AI**: Add SHAP values and LIME explanations for clinical interpretability
